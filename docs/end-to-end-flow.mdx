# End-to-End User Flow

This document outlines the complete user journey for MGZON CLI and GUI applications, from initial installation through backend execution.

## Installation Phase

### CLI Installation Options

Users can install MGZON CLI through multiple channels:

1. **NPM Package Manager**
   - Command: `npm install -g @mgzon/cli`
   - Downloads and installs via Node.js package registry
   - Requires Node.js 16+ and npm 7+

2. **Standalone Executables**
   - Direct download from GitHub releases
   - No Node.js dependency required
   - Platform-specific binaries for Linux, macOS, Windows

3. **GUI Application**
   - Desktop app download from releases
   - Includes bundled CLI functionality
   - Cross-platform Electron-based application

### Post-Installation Setup

After installation, users typically:
1. Verify installation with `mz --version`
2. Authenticate with `mz login` (or GUI login button)
3. Configure project settings if needed

## User Interaction Phase

### CLI User Flow

```bash
# 1. Authentication
mz login                    # Interactive login process
mz whoami                   # Verify authentication status

# 2. Project Creation
mz init my-project --template=nextjs
cd my-project
npm install

# 3. Development
mz serve                    # Start local development server
# Edit files in IDE

# 4. Deployment
mz deploy                   # Deploy to MGZON cloud
mz apps:list               # View deployed applications
```

### GUI User Flow

1. **Launch Application**
   - Double-click desktop icon or run executable
   - GUI initializes and checks for CLI availability

2. **Authentication**
   - Click "Login" button in header or Settings
   - Browser opens for OAuth/authentication flow
   - GUI updates user status upon successful login

3. **Project Management**
   - Use Dashboard for quick actions
   - Navigate to Projects section
   - Click "New Project" or "Open Existing"
   - Fill project creation form (name, template, location)
   - GUI calls CLI commands in background

4. **Development Workflow**
   - Click "Start Server" for local development
   - Terminal panel shows real-time output
   - Edit files externally (GUI doesn't include editor)

5. **Deployment & Management**
   - Use "Deploy" button for production deployment
   - Monitor progress in terminal output
   - Manage apps through Apps section

## Backend Execution Phase

### CLI Backend Flow

When a CLI command executes:

1. **Command Parsing**
   - Commander.js parses command-line arguments
   - Routes to appropriate command handler

2. **Authentication Check**
   - Validates stored API tokens
   - Refreshes tokens if expired

3. **API Communication**
   - Makes HTTP requests to MGZON API endpoints
   - Uses Axios for HTTP client functionality
   - Handles rate limiting and error responses

4. **Local Operations**
   - File system operations (read/write configs)
   - Process spawning for build/deploy operations
   - Template scaffolding for new projects

5. **Output Formatting**
   - Formats responses using Chalk for colors
   - Displays progress with Ora spinners
   - Handles both success and error states

### GUI Backend Flow

The GUI acts as a frontend wrapper around CLI commands:

1. **IPC Communication**
   - Electron's IPC channels handle UI ↔ main process communication
   - Main process spawns CLI executables

2. **CLI Execution**
   - GUI detects bundled or system CLI
   - Spawns CLI processes with appropriate arguments
   - Captures stdout/stderr for display

3. **File System Access**
   - Uses Electron APIs for file/folder selection
   - Passes file paths to CLI commands

4. **Real-time Feedback**
   - Terminal output panel shows live command execution
   - Progress indicators for long-running operations

## Data Flow Architecture

```
User Action → GUI/CLI → Command Handler → API Client → MGZON Backend
      ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
   UI Update    IPC/Event     Business Logic    HTTP Request   Database/API
```

## Error Handling & Recovery

- **Network Issues**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Authentication Errors**: Prompt for re-login
- **File System Errors**: Clear error messages with suggested fixes
- **Build Failures**: Detailed error logs with troubleshooting tips

## Security Considerations

- API tokens stored securely (keychain on macOS, credential manager on Windows)
- HTTPS-only communication with MGZON APIs
- Input validation on all user-provided data
- No sensitive data logged in terminal output
