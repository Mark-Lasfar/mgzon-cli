# User Flow Guide

This guide walks through typical user workflows for both CLI and GUI interfaces, from initial setup to advanced operations.

## Authentication Flow

### CLI Authentication

```bash
# Start the login process
mz login

# The CLI will:
# 1. Open your default browser
# 2. Navigate to MGZON authentication page
# 3. Prompt for credentials or OAuth approval
# 4. Store authentication token securely

# Verify successful login
mz whoami
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ You are logged in:
👤 Name: John Doe
📧 Email: john@example.com
🆔 User ID: abc123...
🎯 Role: Developer
```

### GUI Authentication

1. **Launch GUI Application**
   - Double-click the desktop icon

2. **Access Login**
   - Click "Login" button in the header, or
   - Navigate to Settings → Authentication → "Login to MGZON"

3. **Complete Authentication**
   - Browser window opens automatically
   - Complete login process in browser
   - GUI updates to show logged-in status

4. **Verification**
   - User info appears in header
   - Dashboard shows authenticated features

## Project Creation Flow

### CLI Project Creation

```bash
# Navigate to desired parent directory
cd ~/projects

# Create new project with template
mz init my-awesome-app --template=nextjs

# Navigate into project
cd my-awesome-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
mz serve
```

**What happens during `mz init`:**
- Creates project directory structure
- Downloads selected template
- Initializes package.json and configuration files
- Sets up basic project scaffolding

### GUI Project Creation

1. **Access Project Creation**
   - Click "New Project" on Dashboard, or
   - Navigate to Projects → "Initialize New Project"

2. **Configure Project**
   - Enter project name
   - Select template (Next.js, React, Vue, etc.)
   - Choose project location (browse dialog)

3. **Create Project**
   - Click "Create Project" button
   - GUI shows progress in terminal panel
   - Project creation completes

4. **Post-Creation**
   - Option to open project in external editor
   - Quick access to start development server

## Development Workflow

### Local Development (CLI)

```bash
# Start development server
mz serve

# Server starts on default port (usually 3000)
# Open http://localhost:3000 in browser

# Make code changes in your editor
# Server auto-reloads on file changes

# Stop server with Ctrl+C
```

### Local Development (GUI)

1. **Start Server**
   - Click "Start Server" on Dashboard
   - Or navigate to Projects → select project → "Serve"

2. **Monitor Output**
   - Terminal panel shows server startup logs
   - Displays local server URL

3. **Development**
   - Edit files in external editor
   - GUI shows real-time server output
   - Access app at displayed localhost URL

## Deployment Flow

### CLI Deployment

```bash
# Ensure you're in project directory
cd my-awesome-app

# Deploy to production
mz deploy

# CLI will:
# 1. Build the application
# 2. Upload to MGZON servers
# 3. Configure domain and SSL
# 4. Provide deployment URL
```

**Deployment Output:**
```
🚀 Starting deployment...
📦 Building application...
✅ Build completed
📤 Uploading to MGZON...
✅ Upload completed
🌐 Configuring domain...
✅ Deployment successful!
🌐 App available at: https://my-awesome-app.mgzon.app
```

### GUI Deployment

1. **Initiate Deployment**
   - Click "Deploy" on Dashboard, or
   - Navigate to Projects → select project → "Deploy"

2. **Monitor Progress**
   - Terminal panel shows build progress
   - Real-time upload status
   - Configuration steps

3. **Completion**
   - Success notification with app URL
   - Quick access to view deployed app

## App Management Flow

### CLI App Management

```bash
# List all apps
mz apps:list

# Create new app
mz apps:create my-new-app

# View app details
mz apps:info my-new-app

# Delete app
mz apps:delete my-new-app
```

### GUI App Management

1. **Access Apps**
   - Navigate to Apps section
   - Click "Refresh" to load current apps

2. **Create App**
   - Click "Create App" button
   - Enter app name and configuration
   - GUI calls backend API

3. **Manage Apps**
   - View app list with status indicators
   - Access app details and settings
   - Delete apps with confirmation

## File Storage Flow

### CLI File Operations

```bash
# Upload a file
mz storage:upload ./my-file.jpg

# List storage files
mz storage:list

# Delete a file
mz storage:delete file-id-123
```

### GUI File Operations

1. **Upload Files**
   - Navigate to Storage section
   - Click "Upload File" button
   - File browser dialog opens
   - Select and upload file

2. **Manage Storage**
   - View file list with metadata

   - Monitor storage usage

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Common Scenarios

**Authentication Expired:**
```bash
mz login  # Re-authenticate
```

**Deployment Failed:**
- Check terminal output for specific errors
- Verify project configuration
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
- Try deployment again

**Network Issues:**
- Commands automatically retry on network failures
- Check internet connection
- Verify MGZON service status

### GUI Error Handling

- Error messages displayed in terminal panel
- Clear error descriptions with suggested fixes
- Automatic retry for transient failures
- Fallback to manual CLI commands if needed

## Advanced Workflows

### Environment Management

```bash
# Switch between environments
mz config:set environment=staging
mz deploy --env=staging

# View current configuration
mz config:list
```

### Team Collaboration

```bash
# Share project with team
mz apps:invite user@example.com

# Manage team permissions
mz apps:permissions:list
mz apps:permissions:update user@example.com editor
```

### CI/CD Integration

```bash
# Generate deployment tokens
mz keys:generate --name="CI/CD Pipeline"

# Use in automated scripts
curl -X POST https://api.mgzon.com/deploy \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEPLOY_TOKEN"
```
