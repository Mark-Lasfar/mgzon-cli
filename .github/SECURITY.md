You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions
2. Audit code to find any potential similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all supported releases
4. Release security updates as soon as possible

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 2.0.8 → 2.0.9). Critical security issues may warrant immediate releases.
